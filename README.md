# data-projects
This repository is where I store my data projects done in Google Colaboratory Notebooks.
One reason is so that I can revisit my past work if I need to remind myself how something is done.
Another reason is so that I can share my work with others.

# Viewing Notebooks
If the notebook fails to render in GitHub, then go to https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ and enter the notebook's GitHub link.
